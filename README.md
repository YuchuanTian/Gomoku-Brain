# Gomoku-Brain
This is a C++ Gomoku Brain based on Greedy Algorithm.
The input follows a format (cf. testcase1.txt).
A"START" command is needed; then three chesses are placed via command "PLACE x y"
After that, a "DONE" command and a "BEGIN" command is inputted.
The program will output coordinate at its round; otherwise it will receive command "TURN x y", representing that its component is placing a chess at coordinate (x,y).
An "END" command is needed to terminate the whole process.
